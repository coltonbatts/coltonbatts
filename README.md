# Colton Batts

I build stuff with computers and I also paint.

### 🎨 The Manifesto
> I’m tired of how software works now. I don’t like the subscription-everything model or the feeling that you’re just renting your tools from a corporation. 
> 
> I like physical media, I like owning things outright, and I think software should feel more like that. If I build something and you buy it, it’s yours.

### 🚀 Projects
*   **[ColorWizard](https://github.com/coltonbatts/colorwizard)** – This is what I’m working hardest on. It’s a tool for oil painters to analyze light and color using spectral mixing.
*   **[OpenClaw Inspector](https://github.com/coltonbatts/OpenClaw_Inspector)** – A simple GUI for monitoring what my AI agents are actually doing.

---

### 🛠️ Currently Working On
*   Messing with a **homelab setup** on an old Mac Mini to keep more of my work off other people's servers.
