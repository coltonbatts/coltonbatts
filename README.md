# Colton Batts

I build software for creative people. Right now, my main focus is **VCR**.

![Welcome to VCR]([https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coltonbatts/VCR/main/welcome%20to%20VCR.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coltonbatts/VCR/main/assets/welcome%20to%20VCR.jpg))

## Featured Project: VCR (Video Component Renderer)

**VCR** is a headless motion graphics renderer for generating broadcast-ready ProRes 4444 with alpha from declarative scene files.

- Repo: [coltonbatts/VCR](https://github.com/coltonbatts/VCR)
- Focus: fast, deterministic motion graphics workflows without GUI lock-in
- Use cases: lower thirds, overlays, procedural graphics, repeatable branded motion systems

## Why I'm Building It

I care about creative tools that are ownable, scriptable, and built for long-term control instead of subscriptions and lock-in.

## Currently Working On

- Expanding VCR examples and docs
- Improving render ergonomics and pipeline reliability
- Building practical motion presets for real edit workflows

## Other Projects

- [CHROMA](https://github.com/coltonbatts/chroma): a tool for oil painters to analyze light and color with spectral mixing
