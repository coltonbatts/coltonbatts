### Projects
*   **[CHROMA]((https://github.com/coltonbatts/chroma))** – This is what I’m working hardest on. It’s a tool for oil painters to analyze light and color using spectral mixing.

###  Currently Working On
*   Messing with a **homelab setup** on an old Mac Mini to keep more of my work off other people's servers.
