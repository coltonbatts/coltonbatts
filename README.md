# Colton Batts

I build stuff with computers and I also paint.

### Projects
*   **[ColorWizard](https://github.com/coltonbatts/colorwizard)** – This is what I’m working hardest on. It’s a tool for oil painters to analyze light and color using spectral mixing.
*   **[OpenClaw Inspector](https://github.com/coltonbatts/OpenClaw_Inspector)** – A simple GUI for monitoring what my AI agents are actually doing.

###  Currently Working On
*   Messing with a **homelab setup** on an old Mac Mini to keep more of my work off other people's servers.
