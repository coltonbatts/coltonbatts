Colton Batts
I build stuff with computers and I also paint.

I’m tired of how software works now. I don’t like the subscription-everything model or the feeling that you’re just renting your tools from a corporation. I like physical media, I like owning things outright, and I think software should feel more like that. If I build something and you buy it, it’s yours.

Projects
ColorWizard – This is what I’m working hardest on. It’s a tool for oil painters to analyze light and color using spectral mixing.

OpenClaw Inspector – A simple GUI for monitoring what my AI agents are actually doing.

Currently messing with a homelab setup on an old Mac Mini to keep more of my work off other people's servers.
