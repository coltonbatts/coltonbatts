## How I Work

**Philosophy:** Creatives shouldn't choose between artistic control and automation. I build systems that do both.

**Approach:**
1. **Start with tools** → Understand what's possible (AI, code, design systems)
2. **Build workflows** → Turn tools into repeatable, scalable processes
3. **Share openly** → Document everything so others can learn + build on it
4. **Ship fast** → Done > perfect. Iterate based on real use
